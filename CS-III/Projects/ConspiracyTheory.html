      <h2>The Basics of Reccomendation Algorithms</h2>
      <p>In todays society we're all always online, whether it be for work or shopping or countless other things. Humans are connected together in this thing we call the Internet. Now with the rise of online activity comes the want to profit of these actions. So the Reccomendation Algorithm was born, meant to give you what you want and give the advertisors a straight shot into there customer base. For example say an individual is scrolling through Youtube and watched alot of fishing videos, the algorithm would recognize that he likes fishing videos and reccomend more of them, whilst at the same time pushing advertisments that sell fishing equipment. This way the individual is more likely to buy goods from the advertisor, and the customer is happy because he gets new fishing videos.</p>
      <h2>The Feeback Loop</h2>
      <p> Feedback loops are essentially what we discussed above, lets go over it in more detail. The way a feedback loop works is the more of something you consume the more the algorithm will push that thing to you. For example if you watch alot of fishing videos and engage with them such as likin, commenting, or subscribig to fishing channels then the algorithm will use a Feedback loop and see that you're engaging with fishing videos therfore you want fishing videos and the more you watch, the more you'll get. This will continue until youre watching the extremes of fishing, or finally get out of the loop by not watching fishing videos.
	<h2>Conspiracy Theories & Algorithmic Amplification</h2>
      <p>Nothing quite exemplifies the previous principles like Conspiracy Theories. With the current prioritization of keeping users engaged on your platform the endless spiral that can come from Conspiracy Theories is almost unrivaled. Thrilling ideas right on the edge of beleivability that keeps users clicking on the next title. Through clickbait and a dedicated fanbase real money can be made. This leads to more channels and less and less beleivable things, meaning misinformation is spread rapidly.</p>
      <h2>Platform Incentives</h2>
      <p>Channels and independant creators aren't the only ones who benefit from this Conspiracy theory rabbit hole. The company such as YouTube gets paid by advertisers and the more people watch the more the company gets paid. With the channels making more money and the company making more money its easy to see why the reccomendation Algorithm might push these types of videos. It makes the company money by keeping the users mindlessly watching for hours on end. This can lead to the rapid spread of misinformation for profit.</p>
      <h2>Potential for Exploitation</h2>
      <p> With all of this money potential some have taken to making blatently false videos with flashy titles, and engaging thumbnails knowing that it will engage people. Often times people take these videos for truth or even if they don't. They plant the seeds of doubt in there minds allowing for future intrigue into the Conspiracy theory world. We see it on the news everyday the worse the news the better it sells and with only your imagination holding you back, the spread of Misinformation through the bolstering of these Conspiracy Theory videos is a growing problem in todays world.</p>
