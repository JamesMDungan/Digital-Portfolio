      <u>Population</u>- the entire collection of individuals or objects about which information is desired<br>
      <u>Census</u>- performed to gather information about the entire population<br>
      <u>Sample</u>- a subset of the population randomly selected for study in a defined manner<br>

      <h3>Measures of central tendency</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="left">
      <p class="tab"><u>Median</u>-the middle of the data; 50th percentile; the (n+1)/2 term when the data points are listed in order from least to greatest<br>
	<u>Mean</u>-the arithmetic average<br>
	<u>Mode</u>-the observation that occurs the most often,  if all values only occue once there is no mode, there can be more than one mode<br>
	<u>Resistant</u>-when a statistic is not affected by outliers(it resists the affect of outliers)<br>

	<b><u>How does the shape of the grapg affect the mean and median?</u></b>-In a symmetrical distribution the mean = median<br>
	-the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew wether left or right<br>
	-The mean is not always a good representation of dat because it can be skewed by outliers<br>
	<u>Variability</u>-how spread out the data is<br>
	-variability is important because it allows us to distinguish between usual and unusual values<br>
	-In some situations we want more variability and in others we want less<br>

	-<u>Correlation coefficient(r):</u> There is a strength(strong, moderate, or weak), direction(positive or negative), linear relationship between x-variable and y-variable.<br>
	-<u>Coefficient of determination(r^2):</u> r^2% of the variation in the y-variable can be explained by the approximate linear relationship between x-variable and y-variable.<br>
