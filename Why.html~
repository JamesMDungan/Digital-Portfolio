    <h1> Why a Digital Portfolio is Important to Me</h1>
    <p> The Digital Portfolio is a new concept to me introduced this year by my teachers. At first I wasn't to keen on the prospects of it however while looking at examples on how to make Digital Portfolios I slowly started to see there value.<br>
      A Digital Portfolio will help me organize my accomplishments to show to future employers and others. As well as Show off apects of myself that may be of interest to others.</p>
