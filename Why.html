	<h1> Why a Digital Portfolio is Important to Me</h1>
    <p class="tab"> The Digital Portfolio is a new concept to me introduced this year by my teachers. At first I wasn't to keen on the prospects of it however while looking at examples on how to make Digital Portfolios I slowly started to see there value.<br>
      A Digital Portfolio will help me organize my accomplishments to show to future employers and others. As well as Show off apects of myself that may be of interest to others. It can be used to store my work such as essays or projects that I finish during my time as a Computer Science Student.</p>
