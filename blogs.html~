    <p>Don't we all just love the Allen School District. A couple days ago some students were invited to give there input on changes that should made around the school distict. Some things that were discussed were more funding for technical clubs decreased amount of website blocking etc. The school looked at these ideas and decided you know what screw it were gonna do the exact opposite. They have w shut down the use of persoanl devices leaving students with one question why? Well because they want us to be secure, that was sarcasm ladies and gentlemen because they just want more control over our lives. They want more and more. They want us to use there devices so they can monitor what we do at all times even when not at the school. This just sickens me. I wish they would wake up to reality and realize that more contol is not the solution. They want us to use there devicezz but at the same time those devices block half if not more of the necessary applications we need to operate especially as a CS class. Not to mention the lack of being able to download stuff cripples the students from learning.</p>
