    <h2 style="font-size:30px">What I learned in Computer Science 1</h2>
    <p>Computer Science taught me lots of skills. Aside from just computer skills of course. Computer Science I was the first class that really challenged me. I had to learn time management to keep up with missions, as well as how to research topics on my own to improve my understanding of the material. It definantly taught me patience as I tried to figure out problems. However the most valuable thing I learned in this class was about other people, while this course was solo based and while there weren't many collaborative projects my classmates and I would collaborate together (legally of course) to figure out problems which leds to me learning about how to collaborate with others.</p><br>

    <p>Then on the skills side I learned how to Use Emacs and Swift as well as HTML through the Journal entries. I learned how to learn information off a Wiki and how to apply that information to projects.</p><br>
