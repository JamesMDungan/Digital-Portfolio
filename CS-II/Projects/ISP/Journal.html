    <h4>Personal Plan for the week</h4>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/CSAllenISD/2023-ISP-Ludicrous/issues/71"> Github Issue regarding what I want to accomplish this week</a></h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> My personal plan for this week will involve updating the Gantt Chart for the group allowing us to easily check our progress. Try to spend more time reaching out to members who havn't been active in the project. This will allow us to get more hands on deck and get more of the work done faster. I will also be working on implimenting the new mobs and effects system into the project. This will be necessary for the building of the ISP finishing the effects we need for the MVP.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The Gantt chart shows the progress our group has made so far. We are made steady progress on the ISP, we were originally extremely behind schedule but thankfully thats because we had the end date of the ISP as March 30th giving us much less time to work on it, Thankfully we've fixed it and the pace is looking on track for completion.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The technical challenges I faced this week were in regard to SFTP. I had alot of difficulty figuring out ways to get my gantt chart into my ssh. These included SCP from my windows powershell, to trying to download through SFTP. Until I finally just uploade the image through Github.</p>

    <p class="double"> The technical challenges I faced this week were over the room designes. I thought for a couple days on new room designs that would be easy to impliment and fun to play. I came up with a jail room and am beginning to create the model in the roblox engine.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Scheduling Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The scheduling challenges we faced this week were suprisingly low. We had our first real meeting in a while and communicated what we were going to do very clearly. Only 1 memeber couldn't show up to the meeting so attendence was high.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The only Interpersonal challenges we faced this week were in regard to our attendance at our meeting and the argument over designing the weapons. One of our team members couldn't make it to the meeting so they missed out on there assignments. The conversation about the weapons was ove how to design them whether to use the bult in designer or to use a secondary program. We decided to use a mix o both for differing weapons.</p>

    <p class="double"> The technical challenges we faced this week were finding ways that I can work on the ISP without a VPN. The VPN struggle bested me and I might try in a bit but not for a while. I'll just do my best to keep up progress.</p>

    <h4>Scheduling Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> We didn't have a scheduling conflict this week because we didn't really schedule anything. I don't think anyone had the vigor to do a meeting so we didn't really have one and everyone just worked on there individual assignments. Especially since there was a 4 day weekend progress was very slow.</p>

    <h4>Scheduling Challenges</h4>

  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The Scheduling challenges we faced this week are in regard to the lack of our weekly meeting as a result of superball sunday.

    <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>

  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The technical challenges I faced this week are again the result of the wifi blocking the application needed to work on the ISP. With this blocked memebers are forced to either use a VPN or work at home which can be more difficult fore some.</p>

    <h4>Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double">Once again just like last week we don't have many Interpersonal challenges due to the fact we are all friends. The only issue is resulting from one of our memebers as we havn't heard from her in 2 weeks and don't know what progress they are making.</p>

    <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The technical challenges we are facing this week revolve round the school wifi. The school wifi blocks the application that we as a group need to work on our ISP. So unless we have VPN's we are forced to work on the ISP at our houses which not everyone has time to do.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Scheduling Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The scheduling challenges we are facing this week are in regard to once again the meeting times. Since we all have dierent schedules it is becoming increasingly more dificult to find a time where all of us can meet. Meaning it is becoming increasingly more difficult for the group to work on the project efficiently instead we're relying on a key member to do most of the weekly work.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The Interpersonal challenges we are facing this week mainly are the same week to week. There are no big Interpesonal conflicts because we as a team usually agree on most things and rely on the more informed members to make more important decisions. This week we didn't really have a meeting and we couldn't meet up at CS forum resulting in a week of very little progress.</p>

    <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The technical challenges that we facing this week are mostly consistent with learning the Lua and the Roblox Studio know how needed to advance the project. We have resolved last weeks problem of the sharing the experience. AS of now we all have access to the game so we can now all make edits. The problems we are facing now are till to do with learning the language as, we currently only have one member who fluently can write in Lua</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Scheduling Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The Scheduling conflicts are essentially the same we faced the week prior. The meeting times don't work for everyone meaning certain members could not attend this meeting. This resulted in less work getting done and a lack of collective knowledge slowing the progress of the project.</p>

  <div class="center">
    <h4>Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
  </div>

    <p class="double"> The Interpersonal Challenges that we as a group are facing are not very prevelant. The only issue is the lack of people that are showing up to the meetings and communicating with the group.</p>

    <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The technical challenges that we are facing as of now are mainly due to roblox. We are having issues sharing the experience (the game file) with everyone in our group. We also had an issue where one of our team memebers apperantly didn't exist on roblox even though he had spent countless hours on it. We resolved this issue my reactivating his account and sending him the experience link. Besides these issues the looming technical issue is the new feild of roblox game builidng a feild where only one of our members has experience so learning to navigate this new world will definitly be a challenge we must face in the coming future.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Scheduling Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The Scheduling challenges that we faced this week are related to the meeting times. We as a group decided to have a weekly meeting to go over the work we accomplished and the work that we need to get accomplished in the coming week. Since everyone is very busy we came up with several different ideas for when we could possibly do these weekly meetings. We had to sort through everyones schedules and ended up with the time of 4 o'clock on sundays in the afternoon. However we could also push it back to 9 o'clock on sunday with possible mid week meetings at CS Forum.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="center">
    <h4>Interpersonal Challenges</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> The Interpersonal challenges that we faced this week are mostly regarding staying on task. When we had our team meeting memebers kept getting off task which slowed productivity. In the future we're gonna place Higher importance on attention in the meeting so all members can get the most out of it.</p>

    <h3><B>2-Jan-2023</B></h3>
    <h4>Roles</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="left">
    <p class="double"> A Development Engineer is the member who creates new code and improves existing code. Personally I do not feel that I would be the best suited for this position in my team. I dont beleive I am a terrible coder but I am definitly not the best in my group. I feel that I would have trouble navigating the complications of this large project especially in a language that im not all together familiar with. Lua while not a terrible challenging language can get pretty confusing if you don't know what you are doing which I feel in most cases I would not. So for me to be placed in this position would be simply ludicrous (get it cause project name is ludicrous). I would solve this problem by dedicating extra time to understanding lua and especially Roblox game design.</p>
    <p class="double"> A QA Engineer is the member ensures that the software passes all tests before being released to the public. I feel as if I would be adequate in this role but not exceptional. I do love testing games to there limits however I feel as if there are other more qualified members on my team for this position. I survive in this position but I would not thrive which is not ideal for the development of our game. I feel like a major issue would be allocating this position to just one individual, since everyone is creating there own mechanics 1 tester might miss those they did not add themselves. To solve this we will create lists of all features in our game and update it regularly to make the QA Engineers life easier.</p>
    <p class="double"> A Project manager is the member that is in charge of planning and the execution of the project. I feel as if this position would actually suit me because I am very good at solving interpersonal problems as well as general leadership. I think that in this position I could most benefit the team with the leadership skills that I have, and my ability to keep the environment light while keeping the team on task. I feel like the largest problem would be communication across the team since we don't have a simple easy way to get to all members it will be difficult to communicate and coordinate progress on the game. I will solve this by instructiong those in the group that do not have discord to install it and by creating a mutual server where we can share Ideas and communicate.</p>
    <p class="double"> A Product manager is the member who identifies the customer need and the larger business objectives that a product or feature will fulfill. I feel like I would be decenty suited for this position. I feel like as far as consumers in the game market go I might be the most experienced in our team. I feel this way because of the countless hours I have spent looking at gaming trends and forums of popular games related to our project such as Goat simulator. With this knowledge I feel like I can steer our project in the right direction for those playing the game. The greatest issue would be the ever changing market for games. I would address this problem by constantly staying on top of our competitors reveiws and forums to ensure we have the best game for the consumers.</p>
    <p class="double"> A Release manager responsible for the release management lifecycle, focusing on coordinating various aspects of production and projects into one integrated solution. They are responsible for ensuring that resources, timelines, and the overall quality of the process are all considered and accounted for. I feel as if I would be mediocre in this position  I would definitly face the challenge of thinking in the large picture. I would solve this problem by regularly keeping in touch with the team members and there progress in different parts of the game.</p>
