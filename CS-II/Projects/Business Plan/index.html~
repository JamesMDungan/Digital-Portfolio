    <p class="tab">Hello my name is James Dungan and I am currently a Junior in High School and I love going to National Parks. However there is a rising problem for said Parks. Attendance is rapidly declining. The pandemic of course left the parks empty and this is a problem that has continued 2 years after the pandemic. People are hesitant to return to National Parks. It is getting insanely expensive to travel between hotels and gas it makes no sense to drive across the country to see a park because of the sheer cost.</p>
    <p class="tab">But with the app I want to create for my ISP we can combat this problem. I want to create an app that allows the user to plan a trip to national parks at minimal cost. I can do this by marking free camping locations in the place of expensive hotels and by marking the cheapest gas is a certain area. Of course google maps and other mapping services can do this so why choose us? Well while other mapping services can provide all those possibilities its up to you to enter each location you want to go to. However with my app all you need to do is enter your final destination and we can mark paths to camps and other activities you might have missed out on if you went with google maps. This would allow a younger generation especially college kids who might not have many funds be able to travel and see the beauty of the National Parks.</p>
    <p class="tab">Now how is this sustainable? I mean money has to be made somehow. The revenue plan is to charge nothing to download the app while also running ads on the screens. This will allow for more people to download the app stretching our popularity which will attract bigger sponsors who can give us money by running ad campaigns on the app. To market this app we can of course use social media and our own ads, however if we can manage to get the NPS (National Park Service) to advertise for us and perhaps put a link to our app on there homepage. On the flip side of revenue we need to talk about expenses. This app while not expensive won't be very cheap either. The app development won't be to overall expensive however the cost of labor as well as the marketing will drain the coffers quickly. Not to mention in the beginning the app isn't designed to make money rather to attract downloads to attract sponsors. </p>
    <p class="tab">The Team we need to put this together is not as large as might be thought. Our current team is only Me James Dungan, however hopefully we can get an app developer as well as someone who knows how to use mapping software. To chart progress we can measure not only the number of visits to our app but also the visits to our amazing National Parks.</p>
